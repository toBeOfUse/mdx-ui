<MdxCarousel>

### Slide One

Welcome to the **MdxCarousel** demo. Each `<h3>` (written as
`###` in Markdown) starts a new slide in the carousel.

### Slide Two

Cards are built automatically from the content between headings. You
can include **bold text**, *italics*, and other Markdown formatting.

### Slide Three

Use the arrow buttons on either side to navigate between slides. The
carousel is fully keyboard-accessible too.

### Slide Four

This is the final slide. The `MdxCarousel` is powered by
**Embla Carousel** and **shadcn/ui** Card components under the hood.
