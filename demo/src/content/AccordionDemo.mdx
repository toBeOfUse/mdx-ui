**What is this library?**

---

This library provides MDX transformer components that convert standard
Markdown elements into interactive UI components like accordions,
popovers, and carousels. Everything above the `---` becomes the
accordion label, and everything below becomes the hidden content.

- Built with **shadcn/ui** and **Radix UI**
- Fully accessible
- Easy to use in any MDX file

**How does the MdxAccordion work?**

---

The `MdxAccordion` scans its children for an `<hr>` element
(produced by `---` in Markdown). Content before the `<hr>` becomes the
trigger label, and content after becomes the collapsible body.
